# Exploring-NYC-Public-School-Test-Result-Scores 

## Project Overview 
Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. 
This Data Analysis project aims to answer three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.
  * Which schools are best for math?
  * Who are the top 10 performing schools?
  * Which NYC borough has the highest standard deviation for total_SAT?
